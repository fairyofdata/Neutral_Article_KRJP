However, you still need to copy some files from Chrome into Chromium for you to use Netflix (or other websites using Encrypted Media Extensions) in Chromium.\n","\n","1. Download and install Chrome (or extract the necessary files, if you know how to do that).\n","2. From the Chrome installation directory (probably /opt/google/chome or something similar), copy libwidevinecdm.so into ~/.config/chromium.\n","3. Restart Chromium.\n","\n","=== Preventing falling back to the standard version of Chromium ===\n","\n","Sometimes, this PPA doesn't get updated within a few days of a release, and in some cases, the version of Chromium in the standard Ubuntu repos may be newer than the version provided by the PPA.
